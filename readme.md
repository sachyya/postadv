Intallation Note
===================
1. Please install the plugin just like any other plugins in WordPress.


Usages
===================
1. After installing the plugin, you will find a textarea meta box "Post Adv" at the sidebar before Featured Image.
2. If you want to add the Adsensce script per post then you can add it there. This also is prioritized one. Which means the script of here is used in the shortcode.
3. If you don't want to add the Adsense in each post. Then you can create a page (of any name) and use that page id in the plugin shortcode. Paste the Adsense code in the editor as page content.

Case 1:
If you add a script in the meta box, then you can use [postadv]
Case 2: 
If you do not add a script in the meta box of post then use the shortcode [postadv page="page id"], "page id" is the id of page you've created in above step #3.
